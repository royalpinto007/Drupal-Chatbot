# Chatbot Interface for Drupal Documentation and Contributor Onboarding

## Project Description

Through Google Summer of Code, I revitalized the Drupal Chatbot Module. I developed a chatbot from scratch, designed a versatile Drupal block for seamless integration, optimized UI across devices, and harnessed local data storage. This journey honed my skills, emphasized adaptability, and highlighted the value of open-source collaboration.
